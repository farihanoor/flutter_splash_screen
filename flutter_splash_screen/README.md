# Project Title

A simple flash screen template in flutter.

## Getting Started

The splash screen can be integrated with any app of your choice.

### Prerequisites

This project was created using Flutter 2.0.4. Some old buttons like FlatButton, RaisedButton have been deprecated in Flutter 2.0+.
Instead of FlatButton, you can use TextButton. The format also has changed slightly. I have used FlatButton for the project.
Though it's deprecated, it still works.

### Installing

A step by step series that tell you how to get a development env running.

Step 1: Download the zip or clone it in your ide.

Step 2: All the images are stored in 'assets/images/'. Add your images to the folder.

Step 3: In pubspec.yaml file, import the images. For example:

    -assets:
      - assets/images/yourImage.png

 Step 4: Import the images in splash.dart file.

 Step 5: The buttons in the home.dart does not work. This is just a splash screen template.
